# ðŸ”§ Requirements
# Add to requirements.txt:

# nginx
# Copy
# Edit
# openai
# python-dotenv
# And .env:

# env
# Copy
# Edit
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key



# ðŸ”® Next Level Ideas
# Connect reasoning.py to modify bot behavior (e.g., block USD trades if risky).

# Use memory (ChromaDB) to store past reasoning and compare day-to-day.

# Let LLM revise trading rules live based on news.
